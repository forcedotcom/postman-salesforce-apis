  "description": "Composite graphs provide an enhanced way to perform composite requests, which execute a series of REST API requests in a single call.\nRegular composite requests allow you to execute a series of REST API requests in a single call. And you can use the output of one request as the input to a subsequent request.\n\nComposite graphs extend this by allowing you to assemble a more complicated and complete series of related objects and records.\n\nComposite graphs also enable you to ensure that the steps in a given set of operations are either all completed or all not completed. This avoids requiring you to check for a mix of successful and unsuccessful results.\n\nRegular composite requests have a limit of 25 subrequests. Composite graphs increase this limit to 500. This gives a single API call much greater power.\n\nhttps://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite_graph_introduction.htm",
