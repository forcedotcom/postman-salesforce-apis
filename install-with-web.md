Consider this installation option if you can’t install the Postman desktop app.

- [Configure the Collection](#configure-the-collection)
- [Enable CORS in Salesforce](#enable-cors-in-salesforce)
- [Authenticate with Salesforce](#authenticate-with-salesforce)
- [Execute a Request](#execute-a-request)


## Fork the Collection

1. Using a browser, [sign up/in to Postman](https://identity.getpostman.com/login).
2. Navigate to [this link](https://www.postman.com/salesforce-developers/workspace/salesforce-developers/collection/12721794-67cb9baa-e0da-4986-957e-88d8734647e2/fork) to create a fork of the collection.
3. Enter a label for your fork (e.g.: “My fork”).
4. Select a workspace (the default “My Workspace” workspace is fine).
5. Click **Fork Collection**.


## Configure the Collection

1. If needed, navigate to your workspace.
1. Move your mouse over your “Salesforce APIs” forked collection, click on the “three dots” icon next to it and select **Edit** from the menu.

1. Open the **Variables** tab.
1. If needed, update the `CURRENT VALUE` of the `url` variable with:

    - `https://test.salesforce.com` for sandboxes or Scratch orgs.
    - `https://login.salesforce.com` for production, Trailhead Playground and Developer Edition orgs.
    - your custom My Domain URL.

1. Click **Save** if you made some changes to the variables.


## Enable CORS in Salesforce

1. In Salesforce Setup, enter `CORS` in the Quick Find and select **CORS**.
1. Click **New** under Allowed Origins List
1. Enter `https://*.`[`postman.com`](http://postman.com/) as the **Origin URL Pattern**
1. Click **Save**
1. Repeat the previous steps and add `https://*.postman.co` (note the `.co` domain extension)

## Authenticate with Salesforce

You'll need to authenticate with Salesforce to access the APIs. Doing so grants you an access token that is valid for a certain duration.

Repeat this step whenever your access token expires.

1. Move your mouse over the “Salesforce APIs” collection, click on the “three dots” icon next to it and select **Edit** from the menu.
1. Open the **Authorization** tab.
1. Click **Get New Access Token**. This opens a browser tab with the Salesforce login screen.
1. Log in to your Salesforce org.
1. Click **Allow** to grant access to "Salesforce APIs Collection for Postman" to your org.

    At this point, if your environment is correctly set up, you should see a success message and you should be redirected to the Postman UI.

1. Copy the value of the `instance_url` field from the token details view.

1. Click **Use Token**.
1. Open the **Variables** tab.
1. Update the `CURRENT VALUE` of the `_endpoint` variable with the value that you just copied from the `instance_url` field in the access token details.
1. Click **Save**.


## Execute a Request

1. Expand the collection and select the `REST > Limits` request.
1. Click `Send`.

At this point, if your environment is correctly set up, you should see a `200 OK` status. This means that you have successfully authenticated with Salesforce and that you can now use the other collection’s requests.

See [additional documentation](README.md#additional-documentation) for more information on how to keep the collection up to date and work with multiple Salesforce orgs.
