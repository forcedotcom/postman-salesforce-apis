# Installation

1. Download the [latest Postman collection](https://github.com/scolladon/Salesforce-Postman/releases/latest/download/salesforce-apis.postman_export.json) or go to [previous releases](https://github.com/scolladon/Salesforce-Postman/releases). The collection comes as a `salesforce-apis.postman_export.json` file.

1. [Import it in Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/data-formats/#importing-postman-data).

# Usage

1. Clone the "Salesforce Template" Postman environment. Never customize the template directly! Always clone it and link the environment created to the target Sandbox, Trailhead Playground (TP), Developer Edition (DE) or production org.
1. Edit the environment and fill in these variables:
    - url (login, test or mydomain)
    - username
    - password (+ security token if required)
1. Use your preferred authentication method (SOAP login is very convenient). This automatically fills the endpoint url and access token environment variables for subsequent API calls.
1. Use any of the API endpoints from the collection.<br/>
  **Note:** some APIs are just boilerplates (ex : UI API), you need to copy them and customize them (uri + get parameters) according to your need.
